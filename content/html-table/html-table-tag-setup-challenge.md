Challenge

- a new html file name "table.html"
- default html, with title "Understanding Tables"
- a section with headings
  - Main heading: (h1) "Understanding How to Create a Table/List View in HTML"
  - Paragraph: (p) "We will cover table, thead, tr, th, tbody, td, and tfoot' tags in this section, in today's video we will cover 'table, thead, tr and th tags', in next video we will cover 'tbody, td, and tfoot tags' and after that we will learn about some important attributes for these tags.
- after that add a comment saying "Start Here - Insert Table Tab and let's get started."

- now we need to put a link to this file in "index.html" file with text "Go to Table Tag Page"
  - clicking on this link should take us to "table.html" in same tab, no need to open a new tab for this.
- and in "table.html" file we need to add navigational links, for now just one link with text "Go back to Home Page"
  - clicking on this link should take us back to "index.html" in same tab, no need to open a new tab for this.
