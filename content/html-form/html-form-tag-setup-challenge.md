Challenge

- a new html file name "form.html"
- default html, with title "Understanding Form & Inputs"
- a section with headings
  - Main heading: (h1) "Understanding How to Create a Form in HTML to collect data from user"
  - Paragraph: (p) "We will cover form, label, input, textarea, select, option, optgroup, datalist, button' tags in this section, and we will cover these attributes in this section 'id, name, type, placeholder, value, disabled, readonly, step, accept, multiple, checked, max, min, maxlength, minlength'. we will also learn how to submit, reset form, add a simple button in form, add a image submit button in form.
- after that add a comment saying "Start Here - Insert Form Tab and let's get started."

- now we need to put a link to this file in "index.html" file with text "Go to Form Page"
  - clicking on this link should take us to "form.html" in same tab, no need to open a new tab for this.
- and in "form.html" file we need to add navigational links, for now just one link with text "Go back to Home Page"
  - clicking on this link should take us back to "index.html" in same tab, no need to open a new tab for this.
